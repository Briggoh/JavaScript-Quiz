# Timed JavaScript Quiz - Utilizing API Fundamentals

For this project, I developed a web application which functions as a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals. Upon entering the page, the user is met with detailed instructions on how the game is performed. When the "Start" button located beneath the instructions is clicked, Then the user is launched into the timed application.

Once the "start" button is clicked, the timer begins with 60 seconds and the player is presented with a question. If the question is answered correctly, a chime sound byte will play and the player will proceed to the next question. If the question is answered incorrectly, a bassoon sound byte will play and the player will have ten points deducted from their time before proceeding to the next question. 

Once all the questions have been answered, the player is directed to a screen which takes their time finished and presents it as their final score. Beneath this score, the player is instructed to write their initials inside of a text box to be stored with the other high scores.

Once the player has submitted their initials and pressed the "Add to Score Board" button, they are then directed to a page which displays the top ten high scores. If the player has achieved a top score, then it will be displayed on the list. 

If, however, the player runs out of time during the quiz, they will be directed to a page which notifies them of such and urges them to try again. 

Attached below is a screenshot of the quiz application. This is what the player sees once the "start" button is clicked!
